                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p> Cassandra Ortiz was born and raised in Buffalo, NY.  
                    Being from a large extended family has always brought out her outgoing side.  
                    Through the years, she became restless and needed a change.  <br /><br />
                    After college, she moved to Atlanta, GA where she started her family and 
                    developed her career in construction.  As a Full-Time Working mother, she has learned her true strength 
                    and perseverance as a woman.  Rising to become a Manager within her company, 
                    she earned the respect of her fellow colleagues. 
                    
                    <br /><br /> In 2017, Cassandra relocated to Seattle, WA for her husbands job with Amazon.  
                    She continues to work remotely with her company, as well as volunteering her time in the afternoons 
                    to the local church and clothing bank. <br /><br >
                    
                    When she gets a moment for herself, she can get lost in the many craft projects she likes to take on.  </p>

                <h3>Life Goals</h3>
                <p> The world is too big and life is too short to stay in one place to long! <br /><br >
                  After I accomplish my current goal of becoming a software developer, 
                  I want to develop my network and gain as much experience as much as I can. <br /><br /> My husband and I dream to work together 
                  as software contractors, and travel as much as possible in the process.</p>
